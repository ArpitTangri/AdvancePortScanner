# AdvancePortScanner
This Advanced Port Scanner is a Java-based tool that allows users to scan a range of ports on a target host and detect whether they are open or closed. It supports both TCP and UDP port scanning, and includes functionality for ICMP ping to check host availability as well as OS fingerprinting using Nmap.
